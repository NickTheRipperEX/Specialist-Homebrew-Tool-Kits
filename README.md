# Specialist-Homebrew-Tool-Kits

A tools supplement for D&D 5th edition, for use within Foundry VTT. 

Everything you need to craft while on-the-go. Proficiency not included.

This module is a compilation of all my Tool Proficiency supplements for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. Each one gives options for characters to explicitly use a different tool kit for mechanical benefits during their adventures. Each supplement also includes a list of add-on/example items to accompany them.

- Leatherworker's Tools: Bundled into "Masterwork Equipment and Materials", you can make, maintain and improve weapon and armor items made of hide or other leather-like materials.

Bold entries are already in the most recent release of the module and ready-to-use, though they may receive minor tweaks and quality-of-life updates in the future. Underlined entries are included in the repository, but not included in the current release as they are still undergoing initial implementation in Foundry VTT. Other entries are undergoing active development, but not included in either the repository or current release of the module.
